## About

**DongDong** is a fast-paced arcade game inspired by the classic Pong,  
rebuilt with modern game feel, escalating tension, and skill-based mechanics.

The goal stays simple:  
**outscore your opponent before time runs out.**

---

## Key Features

- **Pace Up System**  
  The match gets faster over time:  
  smaller paddles, faster movement, faster balls, and rising tension.

- **Burst Mechanic**  
  A high-risk dash that can launch the ball at extreme speed when timed correctly.

- **Decoy Ball Phase**  
  Multiple fake balls appear to distract both player and AI.  
  Only one ball scores.

- **Adaptive AI Opponent**  
  The AI reacts with delay, makes mistakes, and occasionally performs Burst moves,  
  creating believable and exciting rallies.
